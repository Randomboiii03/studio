# CyberType Defense

## Welcome, Hacker!

You are the last line of defense for a critical system under siege from a relentless barrage of cyber threats. Your weapon? Your keyboard. In **CyberType Defense**, you must type out the names of incoming malware, viruses, and other hostile programs to neutralize them before they breach your firewall. With each defeated enemy, you'll earn points, build combos, and climb the ranks. The system's fate is in your hands.

## How to Play

1.  **Identify Threats:** Enemies will descend from the top of the screen, each identified by a word or phrase.
2.  **Type to Target:** Type the exact word or phrase associated with an enemy into the input field at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Neutralize:** Press **Enter** to fire your turret and destroy the targeted threat.
4.  **Defend:** Don't let the enemies reach the bottom of the screen! If they do, your system's lives will decrease. If your lives hit zero, it's game over.
5.  **Survive and Advance:** Clear waves of enemies to advance to the next level, where new, more dangerous threats await.

## Know Your Enemy: Threat Analysis

As you progress, you will encounter specialized threats with unique behaviors. Study their patterns to become a more effective defender.

| Threat | Level | Description | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Malware** | 1+ | Standard hostile program. | Normal speed and behavior. |
| **Phishing** | 1+ | Deceptive entity that moves faster. | Increased movement speed. |
| **DDoS** | 1+ | Slow but resilient attacker. | Reduced movement speed. |
| **Ransomware**| 1+ | Locks down system resources. | Normal speed and behavior. |
| **Spyware** | 1+ | Fast-moving data thief. | Increased movement speed. |
| **Adware** | 1+ | Distracts and clutters the system. | Normal speed and behavior. |
| **Stealth** | 2+ | Cloaked until it nears the firewall. | Starts nearly invisible and becomes fully visible halfway down the screen. |
| **Glitch** | 3+ | Scrambles its signature periodically. | Its target word will change every few seconds, forcing you to adapt. |
| **Splitter** | 4+ | Splits into two smaller fragments when hit. | Destroying the parent entity spawns two faster, weaker children. |
| **Boss** | 5, 10... | A powerful foe with a long defense phrase. | Requires you to type multiple words in sequence to defeat it. |

## System Power-ups

Occasionally, friendly system processes will appear, offering you a tactical advantage. Type their word to activate them.

| Power-up | Word | Description | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shield** | `antivirus` | Deploys a temporary firewall. | Adds 5 points to your shield, which can absorb incoming enemy hits without losing lives. |
| **Freeze** | `freeze` | Temporarily halts all enemy movement. | All enemies on the screen are frozen in place for 5 seconds. |
| **Nuke** | `reboot` | Eliminates all non-boss enemies. | Instantly destroys every standard enemy on the screen. |

## Scoring and Combos

*   **Base Score:** You earn points for each character in a successfully typed word.
*   **Combo Bonus:** Destroying multiple enemies without making a typo or letting too much time pass between hits will increase your combo multiplier. A higher combo means significantly more points per destroyed enemy.
*   **Power-ups:** Activating a power-up grants you a small point bonus.

## Controls

*   **Type:** Use your keyboard to enter commands.
*   **Submit:** Press **Enter** to submit the word and fire your turret.
*   **Pause/Resume:** Press **Escape (Esc)** to pause the game or resume from the pause menu.

Good luck, hacker. The system is counting on you.
